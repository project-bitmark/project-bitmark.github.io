Project Page Template
=====================

What you have in front of you is a template for Khan Academy open source
project pages and documentation. It'll get you up and running with a project
page like <a href="http://khan.github.io/KaTeX/">KaTeX's</a> in seconds.

This starter kit comes in a few pieces:

* github project page
  - You just need to fill in the blanks - it's like paint by numbers.
* README template
  - Just as important as the project page and just as mind-numbingly easy to
    create.
* documentation starter

Instructions
------------

Before we get started, let's take a few minutes to clarify they whys and hows
of [writing documentation](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2013/09/teach-dont-tell/).
Meet me back here when you've read, understood, and internalized that post.

Great! Thanks for taking the time to go through that. It was well worth it,
right? At this point I think a word is in order to clarify where each of "First
Contact", "The Black Triangle", "The Hairball", and "The Reference" live among
the three pieces I listed above.

First Contact should be available on both the project page and README. Same for
the Black Triangle. After landing on either page a user can get up to speed on
what the project can do for them and get the thing running on their machine.

The hairball and reference live at khan-academy.readme.io. Ask someone to send
you an invite if you don't have a login yet.
